			Python - Almost a Circle Project

This is a 5-day project intended to promote a deep and practical understanding of the Python3 unittest unit testing framework module.

0. tests/ - Create a directory tests in which to begin the process of creating unit tests.

1. models/base.py - This module lays out the foundation for the Base class, which all other classes will be based upon.

2. models/rectangle.py - This module defines the Rectangle class, which inherits from base. The private instance attributes __width, __height, __x, and __y are defined. The private instance attribute is is instantiated by a call to the superclass, Base.

3. The Rectangle class is updated with exceptions for TypeError and ValueError for all setter methods.

4. Add the public method area(self) to the Rectangle class which returns the Rectangle instance's area..

5. Add the public method display(self) which prints the rectangle using the # character.
